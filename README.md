# Java Swing Aquarium

This is a **Java Swing** project that simulates the running of several threads in parallel, demonstrating the use of various design patterns. The application features a simple aquarium simulation, where different objects are represented and interact with one another. Several design patterns are implemented to structure the code effectively and improve maintainability.

### Design Patterns Used:
- **Singleton**: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.
- **Prototype**: Allows cloning of objects to avoid creating new instances.
- **Listener/Observer**: Enables objects to be notified of changes without being tightly coupled.
- **Decorator**: Adds additional responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Memento**: Captures the state of an object and allows restoring it later.
- **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java Swing**: For building the GUI of the aquarium simulation.
- **Java Threads**: For simulating parallel processes and object interactions.
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Abstract Factory, Prototype, Listener/Observer, Decorator, Memento, State.
